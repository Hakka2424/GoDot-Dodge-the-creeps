Dodge the Creeps - Customized Version by Tyreke Hetzel

This is a modified version of the original Dodge the Creeps game made in Godot. Below are the changes and updates made to improve gameplay and aesthetics.

Changes Made:
1. Player Speed Adjustments
Modification: Increased the player's speed.
Purpose: To make the game more skill-based, allowing skilled players to better utilize the faster speed to dodge incoming creeps more effectively.
2. Background Change
Modification: Changed the background to a space theme.
Purpose: This enhances the game's visual appeal by giving it a space-fighting vibe, immersing the player as if they are dodging enemies in space.
3. Potential Enemy Design Change
Future Plan: Considering changing the enemies from the original creeps to meteors.
Purpose: To match the new space-themed background, the enemies may become meteors, making it seem like the player is dodging falling rocks in outer space.
4. Game Sound Adjustments
Modification: Reduced the volume of the gameâ€™s background music and the death sound.
Purpose: The original sound was too loud, so adjusting the volume improves the player's experience by making it less overwhelming while playing.
5. UI Update - Health System (In Progress)
Modification: Added a 3-heart UI to represent player health and added "timer" for score.
Purpose: The hearts will serve as a visual indicator of the player's remaining health. However, the health mechanic is not yet fully implemented. The player currently cannot lose or regain hearts based on gameplay, but this is a work in progress.
Known Issues / To-Do:
Health Mechanic: The 3-heart health system UI is present, but the functionality to track and reduce health based on damage (collisions with enemies) still needs to be implemented.
Enemy Design: The change of enemies from the default creeps to meteor rocks is still under consideration and has not been implemented yet.
Future Plans:
Health System Implementation: Finish implementing the health system where the player loses hearts upon taking damage from enemies.
Enemy Change: Replace the original enemies with meteors to match the space theme.
Additional Tweaks: Continue fine-tuning sound effects, difficulty, and gameplay to enhance the experience.
